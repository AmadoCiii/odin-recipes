  <h2>Tasty Mango Coconut Chia Pudding</h2>
    <p>Thick and creamy mango chia pudding with layers of coconut milk chia pudding and mango puree. Youâ€™ll love the fresh, tropical flavor!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Cup Light Coconut Milk, From a Can</li><br>
      <li>3 Tablespoons Chia Seeds</li><br>
      <li>1 Tablespoon Maple Syrup, or Sweetener of Choice</li><br>
      <li>1 Small Mango, Peeled</li><br>
      <li>Toasted Coconut Flakes (Topping)</li><br>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Stir together coconut milk, chia seeds and maple syrup. Let sit for 5 minutes then stir the mixture again to get out any clumps that formed. Place mixture in the fridge to set, at least 30 minutes but up to 12 hours.</li><br>
      <li>While chia pudding is setting, peel mango and remove flesh. Place mango flesh in a high powdered blender and blend until smooth.</li><br>
      <li>Once chia pudding has set, grab two jars and spoon chia pudding into each. Top with a layer of mango puree and then continue to layer. I did two layers and ended with the chia pudding. Sprinkle a few pieces of toasted coconut on top and enjoy.
    </li><br>
      <li>Refrigerate any leftovers. Mango chia pudding should keep for at least 3-4 days.</li><br>
    </ol>
