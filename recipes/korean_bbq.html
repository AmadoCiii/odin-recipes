    <h2>Short Ribs Worthy of Winter Grilling</h2>
      <p>This dish, known as galbi, is a fine thing to eat in a restaurant, but it also makes for a wonderful and easy meal at home. If you buy English-style short ribs, which are cut along the bone, you must butterfly the meat into a thin, long strip. If the ribs you buy are flanken-style, in which a band saw is used to cut across the ribs, creating half-inch slices of beef dotted with three little bones, rinse them under cold water before seasoning to remove any bone fragments. It’s a good idea to let the ribs marinate for at least two hours to allow the seasoning to penetrate; marinating overnight is even better.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 Pounds short ribs, cut in ½-inch slices across the bones (flanken-style)</li><br>
        <li>1/3 Cup Soy Sauce</li><br>
        <li>1/3 Cup Rice Wine</li><br>
        <li>1/3 Cup Brown Sugar</li><br>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Sesame Oil</li><br>
        <li>2 Tablespoon Black pepper</li><br>
        <li>1/4 Teaspoon Cayenne or Gochujang</li><br>
        <li>1 Medium Onion, Peeled or Quartered</li><br>
        <li>8 Garlic Cloves</li><br>
        <li>1 small Asian pear, peeled, cored and quartered (or use an ordinary pear or tart apple)</li><br>
        <li>1 1-inch Chunk of Ginger, Peeled</li><br>
        <li>2 Teaspoons Sesame Seeds</li><br>
        <li>Lettuce Leaves</li><br>
        <li>Sliced Red Or Green Hot Pepper (optional)</li><br>
        <li>Ssamjang (spicy Korean soybean paste), for dipping (optional)</li><br>
        <li>Steamed Rice (optional)</li><br>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Rinse short ribs in cold water, pat dry and place in a wide shallow bowl. In another bowl, mix together soy sauce, brown sugar, rice wine, sesame oil, black pepper and cayenne.</li><br>
        <li>Put onion, garlic, pear and ginger in the work bowl of a food processor. Grind ingredients to a smooth purée, then add to soy sauce mixture. Add sesame seeds. Thin with ¼ cup water. Pour marinade over short ribs and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Bring to room temperature, drain and discard marinade.</li><br>
        <li>Cook short ribs on a hot grill or under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until nicely browned but juicy. Pile grilled meat on a platter and serve immediately with lettuce leaves on the side. Accompany with sliced hot peppers, ssamjang and steamed rice, if desired.</li><br>
